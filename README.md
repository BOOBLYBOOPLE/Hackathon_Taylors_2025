Descriptions - EcoLuxe is a mobile app that helps users or companies to understand the environmental impact of their everyday spending. By securely importing transaction data, EcoLuxe assigns each purchase a real‐time carbon footprint and an overview of A-Z rating as well as reviews from third-party sources. It then offers actionable tips, greener alternatives, and a points‐based rewards marketplace to motivate users toward lower‐carbon choices.

Challenge and Approach 
Challenge: How might we leverage fintech to drive sustainable financial behaviors in Malaysia by giving users clear, actionable insights into the environmental impact of their everyday purchases?
Approach: 
By using an eco-rating engine, at each transaction, estimate CO₂ emissions and assign an A–F sustainability rating. Unity-powered UI shows a dashboard with monthly “Green Score,” spend breakdown, and trend charts. Detailed transaction view explains “Why this rating?” and offers greener alternatives.
